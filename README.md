### User Stories
```
As a user,
So that I can see what people have been saying,
I'd like to see all peeps.
```
```
As a user,
So that I can focus on something my friend said,
I'd like to view an individual peep.
```
```
As a user,
So that I can have my own handle,
I'd like to sign up.
```
```
As a user,
So that I can interact with my friends as me,
I'd like to sign in.
```
```
As a user,
So that I can say what's been on my mind,
I'd like to post my own peep.
```
```

So that I can see the most popular peeps,
I'd like to see the like count on each peep.
